# Vehicle plates

This mod integrates with WriteEverywhere to import into game placeholders for all vanilla road vehicles. It will be updated as soon as new road vehicles get added to base game or DLCs.
Also contain basic templates automatically loaded for these placeholders. You can just change their fonts or replace them completely by a city custom layout template.
You also can load the basic layouts and edit them in the game as you wish, just use the template replacement tab at Write Everywhere interface to apply it.

My fonts suggestion are: `Mandatory` or `GL-Nummernschild-Eng`. They were not added to this mod due licensing issues.

To customize the format of the text content, there's a feature added to [Addresses Mod](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/74182/Windows) that does the job.
