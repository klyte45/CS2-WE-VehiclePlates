  <LongDescription># Vehicle plates

This mod integrates with WriteEverywhere to import into game placeholders for all vanilla road vehicles. It will be updated as soon as new road vehicles get added to base game or DLCs.
Also contains templates to be loaded in City Layouts tab to fill the placeholders. You can use them or make your own model based on them.

My fonts suggestion are: `Mandatory` or `GL-Nummernschild-Eng`. They were not added to this mod due licensing issues.

The default plate layouts are just suggestive, you can use any model you want. There are the placeholder categories and the default layout colors used for Background/Text of the plates:

- *CATEGORY: Fprmat | BG Color | FG Color*
- BUS: Rectangle | Purple | White
- CAR: Rectangle | Gray | Black
- EMERGENCY: Rectangle | Yellow | Red
- MOTORCYCLE: Square | Gray | Black
- SERVICE: Rectangle | Blue | White
- TAXI: Rectangle | Red | White
- TRUCK: Rectangle | Red | White

You can load the layouts and edit them in the game as you wish.
To customize the format of the text content, watch for feature to be released at [Addresses Mod](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/74182/Windows)</LongDescription>
